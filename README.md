# MindMatters-Mental-Health-App
Mindmatters is a mental health app with evidence-based features, researched and developed as part of my final year project.
The MindMatters app has 3 primary features:

### Lora - The AI Chatbot

Lora the AI Chatbot provides emotional support and acts as a virtual therapist, Lora uses the OKHTTP library to send and receive data from the OpenAI API and runs on the GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. 

### Sleep Tracker

The sleep tracker tracks sleep and provides the user with sleep data from previous sleeps. The sleep tracker uses the MPAndroidChart library to dynamically visualise sleep data in the form of a bar chart, while the ViewModel read and writes sleep data to the device.

### Thought Journal

The journal allows the user to express their thoughts and feelings in the form of short "thoughts", these thoughts are set to auto delete at a time determined by the user. 

### Additional Features

- Passcode 

- Ability to wipe all data

- Swipe Navigation
